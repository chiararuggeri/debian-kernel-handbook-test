      The kernels in Debian are distributed in binary form, built from
      the Debian kernel source. It is important to recognize that
      Debian kernel source may be (and in most cases is) different
      from the upstream (or "pristine") kernel source, distributed
      from <url id="http://www.kernel.org" name="www.kernel.org"> and
      its mirrors. Due to licensing restrictions, unclear license
      information, or failure to comply with the Debian Free Software
      Guidelines (DFSG), parts of the kernel are removed in order to
      distribute the source in the <tt>main</tt> section of the Debian
      archive. The removal procedure is typically performed by a
      <tt>prune-non-free</tt> script, available in the Debian kernel
      SVN repository <footnote>
      <tt>svn://svn.debian.org/kernel/trunk/scripts/prune-non-free</tt>
      </footnote> and producing the
      <tt>linux-<em>major</em>_<em>version</em>.orig.tar.gz</tt>
      tarball, which serves as the original upstream
      source. <em>major</em> is the kernel major version (like 2.6)
      and <em>version</em> is the actual upstream version.

      The guidelines for the driver removals for Etch release have
      been set by the <url
      id="http://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_007" name="Handling
      source-less firmware in the Linux kernel"> General Resolution
      and the <url
      id="http://lists.debian.org/debian-kernel/2006/10/msg00541.html"
      name="position statement"> by the Etch release
      managers. Additional information about removed and questionable
      drivers may be found at the <url id="http://wiki.debian.org"

      The source from which the Debian binary kernels are built is
      obtained by taking the source from
      <tt>linux-<em>major</em>_<em>version</em>.orig.tar.gz</tt> (that
      is, pristine kernel source, processed by the
      <tt>prune-non-free</tt> script) and applying a set of Debian
      patches. These patches typically implement essential fixes for
      serious bugs and security holes. The Debian version of the
      kernel packages has the form <tt><em>version-revision</em></tt>
      where <tt><em>version</em></tt> is the upstream version of the
      kernel (like 2.6.18) and <tt><em>revision</em></tt> determines
      the patchlevel. For example, the packages with version 2.6.18-3
      are built from the <tt>linux-2.6_2.6.18.orig.tar.gz</tt> source,
      patched up to patchlevel 3. Additionally, some architectures
      require architecture-specific patches for the kernel to build
      and operate. Certain flavors of the kernel include patches to
      implement the desired functionality, such as <tt>xen</tt> and
      <tt>vserver</tt>.

    </p>
    <p>

      All the patches used in the process of building of the Debian
      official kernel packages are shipped as a part of
      <tt>linux-patch-debian-<em>version</em></tt> package.  See its
      description in <ref id="arch-indep"> for more information about
      the patch system.

    <heading>Policy for patch acceptance</heading>
    <p>

      The goal of the Debian kernel team is to keep the difference
      between the Debian kernel source and the "pristine" kernel
      source to a minimum.  That typically means that only the patches
      fixing security holes and serious kernel bugs are considered for
      the inclusion in the Debian kernel source. The recommended
      procedure for inclusion of patches introducing optional features
      is to package them as separate patch packages, or to convince
      the upstream maintainer to include them in the next kernel
      release.
