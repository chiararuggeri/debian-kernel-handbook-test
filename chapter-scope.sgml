      The main goal of this handbook is to serve as a single access
      point to all kernel-related documentation. It contains the
      information about the Debian packaging of Linux kernel for the
      Lenny release of Debian (version 5.0). The latest released
      version is always available from <url
      id="http://kernel-handbook.alioth.debian.org"
      name="http://kernel-handbook.alioth.debian.org">. Note that this
      is a work in progress, and some information is inaccurate.

    <p>

      Some of the commands mentioned in the text must be executed with
      superuser priviliges, either by becoming the <tt>root</tt> user
      or by using <tt>sudo</tt>. To distinguish between commands which
      may be executed by an unprivileged user and those requiring
      superuser privileges, commands are prepended by <tt>$</tt> or
      <tt>#</tt> respectively. This symbol is not a part of the
      command.
